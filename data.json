    [36.774042, "“Fears over the potential duration of the UK’s recession rather than hopes for inflation abating are dominating investor concerns for UK assets,” Edward Glyn, head of global markets, said. “Despite low valuations, you can barely give them away at the moment.”"],

    [117.090042, "Investor gloom about the UK does not appear to have fed through into share price movements, however. From the low of October 12, the FTSE 100 is up by just over 10 per cent, matching the S&P 500, while the more UK focused FTSE 250 is up by 14 per cent. The Euro Stoxx 50, which tracks blue-chips in the eurozone, is up by 18 per cent."],
